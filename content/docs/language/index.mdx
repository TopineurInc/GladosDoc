## Introduction

**Topineur** is a modern programming language designed with simplicity and readability in mind. It is made by developers for developers.

## Installation

To get started with Topineur, you'll need to install the **Topineur compiler**.

```bash tab="<Terminal /> Using curl"
# On Linux/macOS
curl -sSL https://topineur.org/install.sh | bash
```

```bash tab="Using wget"
# On Linux/macOS
wget -qO- https://topineur.org/install.sh | bash
```

Verify your installation by running:

```bash title="Bash"
glados --version
```

## Your First Topineur Program

Create a new file called `hello.top` and add the following code:

```topineur title="hello.top"
|- Main function

def main(): Int {
  print("Hello, Topineur!")
}
```

Run your program using:

```bash
glados run hello.top
```

## Basic Syntax

### Variables and Types

In Topineur, you can use different types. For example :

```topineur title="Variables"
let name: String = "World"      |- String Variable
let age: Int = 25               |- Integer Variable
let height: Float = 1.75        |- Float Variable
let isActive: Bool = true       |- Boolean Variable
```

### Functions

Functions in Topineur are declared using the `def` keyword:

```topineur title="Functions"
|- Define a function add
def add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

|- Concatenates strings
def greet(name: String) {
    print("Hello, " ++ {name} ++ "!")
}
```

### Control Flow

Topineur supports standard control flow structures:

```topineur title="Control Flow"
|- If statements
if score > 100
  then print("High score!")
else if score > 50
  then print("Good effort!")
else
    print("Keep trying!")

|- Loops
|- To be implemented
```
